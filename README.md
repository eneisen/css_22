# css_22

This is my code for the exercise of css_2022. It is a website that tells if the user is standing, walking or running.

- To load and preprocess the data, navigate to `data_preprocessing` and execute `python data_preprocessing.py`.
- To train the random forest model and generate js code output navigate to `model` and execute `python train.py`.
- The code for the website can be found in `website`.
